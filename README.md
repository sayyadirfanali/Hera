# Hera
Hera is a monospace font which is a customised version of Source Code Pro which
was originally created by Paul Hunt.

Hera consists mainly of glyphs from Adobe Source Code Pro mixed with glyphs from
popular monospace fonts like Fira Mono, Inconsolata, IBM Plex Mono, etc.

Hera emphasises readability and uniformity for sigils and symbols which makes
it suitable for use in coding environments.

## Feedback
Hera is a very simple font. It doesn't currently feature bold or italics. It
was designed for my own personal workflow.

However, if you do come to use it, feel free to provide valuable feedback and
request for features. I'd be happy to add new features if requested.
