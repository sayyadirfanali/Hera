# Hera
Hera is a coding font which is a customised version of Adobe Source Code which
was originally created by Paul D. Hunt.

Hera consists mainly of glyphs from Adobe Source Code Pro mixed with glyphs from
popular monospace fonts like Fira Mono, Inconsolata, IBM Plex Mono, etc.

Hera emphasises readability and uniformity for sigils and symbols which makes
it suitable for use in coding environments.

## Feedback
Hera is a simple and unpolished font. It doesn't currently feature bold or
italics. I designed it only for my own personal workflow.

However, if you do come to use it, please provide valuable feedback and request
for features. I'd be happy to add new features if requested.
